# DayZ-Code

This repository will be an ongoing compilation of complete files, as well as working and non-working code snippets for use in DayZ servers. Files will be annotated as to the most updated game version they are compatable with, if applicable. If you happen to stumble on this repository, feel free to take a look and take from it what you need. Thank you.
